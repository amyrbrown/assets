In order to evaluate SWC's impact, we need to assess what we are doing in a valid, reliable way.

###Beginning in June 2013, all instructors are asked to:

1. Require registration for boot camps on Eventbrite. Embedded in this registration is a skills survey. Approximately 1 week before the workshop, email Cait Pickens requesting the analysis of results. Instructors will be provided a description of their student audience.
2. **On the morning of first day** of the boot camp, distribute the pre-assessment survey. Ideally, set aside 10 minutes some time before lunch for students to complete the survey. Collect data in paper form if necessary.
3. **At the end of the last day** of the boot camp, distribute the post-assessment survey. Again, the instrument requires approximately 10 minutes to complete. Dedicate specific workshop time to complete the survey. Collect data in paper form if necessary.
4. If any paper assessment materials were collected, mail them to Cait Pickens. Mailing address upon request, caitlynpickens@gmail.com
