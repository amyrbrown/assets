* This article has been formally corrected to address the following
  errors: A minor correction has been made to the function
  “meanExpDict”, where the conditional statement was flipped during
  code refactoring. Further, the instructions have been made more
  clear. Please view the correct File S3...
* For the purposes of data interpretation, the pathways were broken
  into their protein components using an internally developed python
  script where connections of proteins through biochemical substrates
  were maintained as protein-protein interactions PANTHER's internal
  identifiers were mapped to UniProt identifiers.
* Code available in ZIP file: most pieces long, one about the right
  size, but the correction makes it very interesting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Downloaded ZIP file (included Emacs ~ files and .pyc files)
* Extracted the shortest two Python files
