* All analyses were conducted using R (http://www.r-project.org). The
  code used can be found in Text S2. Text S3 contains a short Python
  (http://www.python.org) script that can be used to obtain high
  quality base counts from mapped BAM files. Text S4 contains an
  explanation of the required input files for Text S2 and the output
  generated. Dataset S1 contains an example dataset of the 26 patient
  samples analysed for the presence of mixed ST infection, and
  provides an example of the formatting on the input and output files.
* Has code in article (as text files)

* Downloaded R and Python code; had to give files names 'detector.R' and
  'extractor.py' because originals didn't have names.
