* We used the UniProt-GOA database from December 2011. Data analyses
  were performed using Python scripts. The following tools were used
  in the analyses: Biopython [20], matplotlib [21].
* All data and scripts are available on:
  http://github.com/FriedbergLab/Uniprot-Bâ€‹ias/ and on
  http://datadryad.org (the latter upon acceptance).

* Cloned the repo (contains lots of irrelevant files and build artifacts)
* Extracted two Python files, eco_pmid_stats.py and plplot.py, the second of
  which wasn't actually written by the paper authors.
