Hi everyone,

The Mozilla Science Lab is going to be running an experiment this
summer, and I want to know if you'd like to help.  We would like to
get Mozilla programmers to do short code reviews for scientists who
rely on code they've written themselves to do their research.  We'd
like to see if the sort of code review we do here routinely, which is
pretty much unheard-of in the academic research environment, can make
those scientists' software, research, and lives better.  This isn't
expected to be a huge commitment of time --- 2-4 hours total during
the month of August --- and I'd like to be able to pair volunteers
with somebody working with a field that interests them, if at all
possible.

The specific questions we're trying to answer are:

1. How much scientific software can be reviewed by non-specialists,
   and how often is domain expertise required?

2. How much effort does this take compared to reviews of other kinds
   of software, and to reviews of papers themselves?

3. How useful do scientists find these reviews?

If you'd like to help, please let me know (and if you've got a
particular interested in a specific field, please specify that as
well).

Again, this is a pilot project --- whether or not it grows beyond that
depends on whether or not this turns out to be a valuable experience
for all concerned.  But I'm sure it'll be interesting...

Look forward to hearing from you,
Thanks,
Kaitlin Thaney
